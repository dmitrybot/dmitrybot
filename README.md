# Hi, I'm Dmitry üëã
A beginner Java backend developer. I have no work experience, but I have a great desire to learn this business. At the moment, I really want to develop in the IT field, as for me, this gives a very good load on my head and develops it very much. From the age of 16, I was fond of programming, and the hobby was able to grow into something more. Now I sit day and night with trepidation and joy comprehending the subtleties of programming . However, as Emanuel Lasker said, "The only way to become smarter is to play with a stronger opponent.", so I want to study, study in the company of experienced DS.
